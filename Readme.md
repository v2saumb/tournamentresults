## Introduction
A Python module that uses the PostgreSQL database to keep track of players and matches in a game tournament. 
This project teach us how to create and use databases through the use of database schemas and how to manipulate the data inside the database. This project has two parts: defining the database schema (SQL table definitions), and writing code that will use it to track a Swiss tournament.
