## Introduction
A Python module that uses the PostgreSQL database to keep track of players and matches in a game tournament. 
This project teach us how to create and use databases through the use of database sachems and how to manipulate the data inside the database. This project has two parts: defining the database schema (SQL table definitions), and writing code that will use it to track a Swiss tournament.

## Setup
### Prerequisites
1. Python v2.7 or greater should be installed.
2. PYTHON environment variable should be correctly set with the path to python executable.
3. PYTHONPATH environment variable should be set with the python root folder
4. PostgreSQL installation
5. Vagrant installation if required 
6. The tournament database should be created in the [Creating The Database ](#creating-the-database) section.
7. Clone this repository to some location on your system


###Creating The Database
Before you can run your code or create your tables, you'll need to use the create database command in psql to create the 
database. Use the name tournament for your database.

Asuming you are already logged in to vagrant ssh
1. Navigate to the folder where the repository has been cloned.
2. Use the `psql` command to go to the psql prompt.
3. Use the command `\i tournament.sql` to import the whole file into psql at once. **This will create the database and then create all the required objects.**

## Testing

The file `tournament_test.py` contains the requited test to verify the functionality.

Some new test cases have been added to verify the additional features this version of code supports

** How to run the tests**
1. Navigate to the `tournament` folder.
1. Run the command `python tournament_test`
1. Alternatively run command `python tournament_test >> tournamentTest.log` to pipe output to a log file for easy viewing of the log.

## Assumptions

1. There is no web interface required for this phase of the project.
1. This version of code support both even and odd number of players.
1. The user will have to manually switch the game number and round number whenever reporting the matches
1. The current code has been tested for up to 3 rounds and 3 games per round.
1. When paring the code randomly decides who plays who within the same score group and if there are odd number of players it pushes the first player form the group to the next lower scoring group
1. If there are odd Number of players one of the player receives  a bye win and rest are randomly matched 
1. Most of the scoring and paring logic is based of [SWISS-STYLE PAIRING SYSTEM ](http://www.wizards.com/dci/downloads/swiss_pairings.pdf) by the wizards of the coasts.
1. The test cases have been modified for the additional features.
1. The required environment is available to run the code.
1. Delete all players used in the test cases are only for housekeeping and are not mandatory to be run

## Extra Credit Features

1. Supports multiple tournaments / events
1. Supports odd or even number of players
1. No need to delete the player records (The required methods are provided and used for housekeeping purposes)
1. Prevents matches between players.
1. Supports games where there is a draw.
1. Supports multiple rounds and games per round for an event
